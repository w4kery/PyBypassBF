# Ransomware Brute Force Decryption with Python

THIS IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT. DO NOT USE THIS TO COMMIT CRIME. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOU DOING DUMB STUFF. THIS SOURCE HAS BEEN USED AND MADE AVAILABLE FOR PRESENTATION AND EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES.

## Task Overview

### What you'll learn
- What ‘bruteforcing’ involves
- How to respond to a ransomware virus using Python

### What you'll do
- Write a Python script to bruteforce the decryption key of the encrypted file, to avoid paying a ransom

## Setting the Scene for Your Next Task

An attacker was able to exploit the vulnerability on the affected server and began installing a ransomware virus. Luckily, the Incident Detection & Response team was able to prevent the ransomware virus from completely installing, so it only managed to encrypt one zip file. Internally, the Chief Information Security Officer does not want to pay the ransom, because there isn’t any guarantee that the decryption key will be provided or that the attackers won’t strike again in the future. Instead, we would like you to bruteforce the decryption key. Based on the attacker’s sloppiness, we don’t expect this to be a complicated encryption key, because they used copy-pasted payloads and immediately tried to use ransomware instead of moving around laterally on the network.

## Background Information for Your Task

In this task, you will write a Python script to bruteforce the decryption key of the encrypted file. Bruteforcing is the act of repeatedly trying different combinations to break the password encryption (based on either randomly generated passwords or from a list of passwords to try). In the resource attached to this project, we've provided a small subset of passwords from **Rockyou** - a widely know password wordlist that contains thousands of common passwords in one wordlist. Ransomware will often encrypt all files on a device, and sometimes give the decryption key after the ransom has been paid (but this is not always the case!). In this task, we would like you to break the encryption without paying the ransom.

## Summary

The **Ransomware Brute Force Decryption with Python** project aims to respond to a ransomware attack by bruteforcing the decryption key of an encrypted file, thereby avoiding the need to pay a ransom. The provided Python script leverages   a subset of passwords from the Rockyou wordlist to attempt to decrypt the affected file. The project underscores the importance of proactive cybersecurity measures and highlights practical approaches to handle ransomware   incidents without succumbing to extortion.
